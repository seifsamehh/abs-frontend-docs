## Before Asking for Help

Complete this checklist to get faster help:

- [ ] **Searched documentation** for existing solutions
- [ ] **Checked FAQ** for similar questions
- [ ] **Searched the codebase** for similar implementations
- [ ] **Gathered error messages** and stack traces
- [ ] **Identified steps to reproduce** the issue
- [ ] **Noted what you've already tried**

## How to Ask Effective Questions

### Good Example

**Subject:** TypeScript error with useQuery hook in UserProfile component

**Description:**
I'm getting a TypeScript error when using TanStack Query in the UserProfile
component. The error occurs when trying to access the `user.email` property.

**Error Message:**

```
Property 'email' does not exist on type 'unknown'
```

**Code:**

```typescript
const { data: user } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["user", userId],
  queryFn: () => fetchUser(userId),
});

return <div>{user.email}</div>; // Error here
```

**Environment:**

- Next.js 16.1
- TypeScript 5.9.2
- TanStack Query 5.0.0

**What I've tried:**

- Added type assertion `(user as User).email` - works but feels wrong
- Checked TanStack Query docs for proper typing

### Bad Example

**Subject:** Help!!!

**Description:**
My code is broken and I don't know why. It was working yesterday but now
it's not. Can someone fix this?

**What's wrong:**

- No clear description of the problem
- No error messages
- No context about what changed
- No information about environment
- No code provided
- Demanding rather than asking for help

### Question Template

```markdown
**Subject:** [Clear, descriptive title]

**Description:**
[Brief description of what you're trying to do]

**Problem:**
[What's not working as expected]

**Error Messages:**
[Exact error messages with stack traces]

**Code:**
[Minimal, reproducible code example]

**Environment:**

- [Framework versions]
- [Browser/Node version]
- [Operating system]

**What I've tried:**

- [Solution 1 and result]
- [Solution 2 and result]
```

## Creating a Minimal Reproduction

A minimal reproduction helps others understand and debug your issue:

1. **Start with a fresh project** or CodeSandbox
2. **Add only the code needed** to reproduce the issue
3. **Remove unrelated dependencies** and features
4. **Verify the issue still occurs** in the minimal version
5. **Share the reproduction** via GitHub repo or CodeSandbox link

```bash
# Quick way to create a minimal reproduction
npx create-next-app@latest repro-issue-123 --typescript
cd repro-issue-123
# Add only the minimal code to reproduce
```

## Response Time Expectations

| Priority     | Example                | Expected Response |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Critical** | Production is down     | < 15 minutes      |
| **High**     | Major feature broken   | < 30 minutes      |
| **Normal**   | Bug or question        | < 2 hours         |
| **Low**      | Nice-to-have, learning | < 24 hours        |

## Escalation Path

If you're not getting help:

1. **15 min:** Re-check your question follows the template
2. **30 min:** Tag the relevant team member directly
