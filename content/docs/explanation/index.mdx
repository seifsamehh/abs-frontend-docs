# 💡 Explanation

<Callout type="info">
  **Understand the why!** Explanation documentation helps you gain deeper
  understanding of concepts, architecture decisions, and the reasoning behind
  our choices. Read this when you want context and background.

## Deepen Your Understanding

Explanation documentation is **understanding-oriented** - it discusses concepts, provides context, and answers "why?" questions. It's for when you want to truly understand something, not just know how to do it.
