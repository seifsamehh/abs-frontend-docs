## Getting Technical Help

### Before Asking for Help

1. **Search First**

   - Check this documentation
   - Search internal Slack channels
   - Look through existing GitHub issues
   - Check Stack Overflow for common issues

2. **Gather Information**

   - Error messages and stack traces
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Environment details (Node version, browser, etc.)
   - What you've already tried

3. **Create a Minimal Example**
   - Isolate the problem
   - Remove unnecessary code
   - Use CodeSandbox or similar tools

### How to Ask Effective Questions

<Tabs items={['Good Example', 'Bad Example', 'Template']}>
  <Tab value="Good Example">
    **Subject:** TypeScript error with useQuery hook in UserProfile component

    **Description:**
    I'm getting a TypeScript error when using TanStack Query in the UserProfile component. The error occurs when trying to access the `user.email` property.

    **Error Message:**
    ```
    Property 'email' does not exist on type 'unknown'
    ```

    **Code:**
    ```typescript
    const { data: user } = useQuery({
      queryKey: ['user', userId],
      queryFn: () => fetchUser(userId),
    });

    return <div>{user.email}</div>; // Error here
    ```

    **Environment:**
    - Next.js 15.4.5
    - TypeScript 5.9.2
    - TanStack Query 5.0.0

    **What I've tried:**
    - Added type assertion `(user as User).email` - works but feels wrong
    - Checked TanStack Query docs for proper typing

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Bad Example">

## Self-Help Resources

### Debugging Guides

<Tabs items={['React Issues', 'TypeScript Errors', 'Build Problems']}>
  <Tab value="React Issues">
    **Common React Issues:**

    1. **Component not re-rendering**
       - Check if state is being mutated directly
       - Verify dependencies in useEffect
       - Use React DevTools to inspect state

    2. **Infinite re-renders**
       - Check useEffect dependencies
       - Look for object/function dependencies without memoization
       - Use useCallback/useMemo appropriately

    3. **Props not updating**
       - Verify parent component is re-rendering
       - Check if props are being passed correctly
       - Use React DevTools to trace prop flow

    4. **Event handlers not working**
       - Check if event propagation is being stopped
       - Verify event binding is correct
       - Look for console errors

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="TypeScript Errors">
    **Common TypeScript Errors:**

    1. **Type 'unknown' errors**
       ```typescript
       // Problem
       const data = await response.json();
       console.log(data.name); // Error

       // Solution
       interface ApiResponse {
         name: string;
       }
       const data = await response.json() as ApiResponse;
       ```

    2. **Property does not exist errors**
       ```typescript
       // Problem
       const user = { name: 'John' };
       console.log(user.email); // Error

       // Solution - Update interface
       interface User {
         name: string;
         email?: string; // Optional property
       }
       ```

    3. **Cannot find module errors**
       ```typescript
       // Problem
       import { utils } from './utils'; // Error

       // Solution - Check file path and exports
       import { utils } from './utils/index';
       // or
       import utils from './utils';
       ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Build Problems">
    **Common Build Issues:**

    1. **Module not found**
       - Check import paths
       - Verify file extensions
       - Clear node_modules and reinstall

    2. **TypeScript compilation errors**
       - Run `tsc --noEmit` to check types
       - Check tsconfig.json settings
       - Look for circular dependencies

    3. **Environment variable issues**
       - Verify variable names and prefixes
       - Check .env file location
       - Restart development server

    4. **Memory issues**
       - Increase Node.js memory: `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"`
       - Check for memory leaks in code
       - Consider build optimization

  </Tab>
