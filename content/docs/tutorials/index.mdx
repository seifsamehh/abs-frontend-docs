# 🎓 Tutorials

<Callout type="info">
  **Learn by doing!** Tutorials are guided lessons that help you build skills
  through hands-on practice. Follow along step-by-step and you'll have working
  code by the end of each tutorial.
</Callout>

## What You'll Learn

Tutorials are **learning-oriented** - they guide you through building something real while teaching fundamental concepts. Each tutorial is designed so you can complete it successfully, even if you're new to the topic.

## How to Use Tutorials

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Follow in Order Each tutorial builds on concepts from previous ones.
    Start from the beginning if you're new.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Type the Code Don't copy-paste! Typing helps you learn and remember.
    Make mistakes - they're part of learning.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Experiment After completing a tutorial, try modifying the code. What
    happens if you change something?
  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Move to How-To Guides Once you're comfortable, check out [How-To
    Guides](/docs/how-to) for real-world problem solving.
  </Step>
</Steps>
