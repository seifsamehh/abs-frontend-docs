# Your First Contribution

<Callout type="info">
  This guide walks you through the entire process of making your first
  contribution, from picking a task to getting your code merged.
</Callout>

## Contribution Workflow

<Steps>
  ### Pick a Task

Start with a "good first issue" labeled task:

- Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` in GitHub
- Ask your team lead for a starter task
- Fix a typo in documentation (like this one!)

### Create a Branch

```bash
# Make sure you're on the latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
```

### Make Your Changes

Write your code following our [code standards](/docs/reference/code-standards):

- Use TypeScript
- Follow component patterns
- Add tests for new functionality

### Test Locally

```bash
# Run type checking
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Test the dev server
pnpm dev
```

### Commit Your Changes

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user profile component"
```

### Push and Create PR

```bash
git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

### Address Review Feedback

Respond to review comments and push updates:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review feedback"
git push
```

### Celebrate! 🎉

Once approved and merged, you've made your first contribution!

## Pull Request Guidelines

### When to Create a Pull Request

**For Features:**
- Create a PR when you've completed a feature or a meaningful part of a feature
- Each feature should have its own PR with a clear, descriptive title
- Example: `feat: add Feature 1`

**For Related Features:**
- If you're adding multiple related features in the same PR, include all scopes in the title
- Use comma-separated scopes to indicate multiple related areas
- Example: `feat(ship, pickup): add part of pickup related to shipment`

**For Bug Fixes:**
- Create a PR for each bug fix or related group of bug fixes
- Use the `fix` type with appropriate scope
- Example: `fix(auth): resolve login redirect issue`

**For Multiple Related Bug Fixes:**
- If you're fixing multiple related bugs in the same PR, include all scopes in the title
- Use comma-separated scopes to indicate multiple related areas
- Example: `fix(auth, ui): resolve login redirect and button hover issues`

### PR Title

Follow the same format as commit messages:

**Single Feature:**
```
feat: add Feature 1
```

**Multiple Related Features:**
```
feat(ship, pickup): add part of pickup related to shipment
```

**Bug Fix:**
```
fix(ui): resolve button hover state on mobile
```

**Multiple Related Bug Fixes:**
