### ADR (Architecture Decision Record)

A document that captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. See our [ADR documentation](/docs/reference/decisions).

### API (Application Programming Interface)

A set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

### App Router

Next.js routing system (introduced in v13) that uses the `app/` directory. Supports React Server Components, layouts, and streaming. This is our primary routing approach.

### Atomic Design

Design methodology by Brad Frost organizing components into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages.

---

## B

### Barrel Export

A pattern where a single `index.ts` file re-exports modules from a directory, simplifying imports.

```typescript
// features/users/index.ts (barrel export)
export { UserCard } from "./components/UserCard";
export { useUser } from "./hooks/useUser";
export type { User } from "./types";
```

### Bundle

The final JavaScript file(s) produced by a bundler (like webpack or Turbopack) containing all code needed to run an application.

### Bundle Size

The total size of JavaScript files sent to the browser. Smaller bundles = faster load times.

---

## C

### Cache Invalidation

The process of marking cached data as stale or removing it, triggering a fresh fetch from the server.

### Client Component

React component that runs in the browser. Required for interactivity, hooks, and browser APIs. Marked with `"use client"` directive.

### Code Splitting

Technique of splitting code into smaller bundles loaded on demand, improving initial page load performance.

### Composition

Design pattern where complex components are built by combining simpler ones, rather than using inheritance.

### CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

Rendering that happens entirely in the browser. The server sends minimal HTML and JavaScript renders the content.

### CSS-in-JS

Approach where CSS is written inside JavaScript files. Examples: styled-components, Emotion.

### CVA (Class Variance Authority)

Library for creating component variants with Tailwind CSS. Used extensively in our component library.

```typescript
const buttonVariants = cva("rounded px-4 py-2", {
  variants: {
    variant: {
      primary: "bg-blue-500 text-white",
      secondary: "bg-gray-200 text-black",
    },
  },
});
```

---

## D

### Dark Mode

UI theme with light text on dark backgrounds. Implemented via CSS variables and Tailwind's `dark:` modifier.

### Debouncing

Technique that delays function execution until a pause in calls. Used for search inputs and resize handlers.

Design pattern where components receive their dependencies rather than creating them internally.

### DevTools

Browser extensions or built-in tools for debugging. Examples: React DevTools, Redux DevTools, TanStack Query DevTools.

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

TanStack Query setting determining how long inactive queries remain in cache. Previously called `cacheTime`.

### Git Flow

Branching model for Git. Our variation uses `main`, `stage`, and feature branches.

---

## H

### HOC (Higher-Order Component)

Function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality. Less common now due to hooks.

### Hooks

React functions (prefixed with `use`) that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

### Hydration

Process where React attaches event listeners and makes server-rendered HTML interactive in the browser.

### Hydration Error

Mismatch between server-rendered HTML and client-rendered content causing React warnings or broken UI.

---

## I

### i18n (Internationalization)

### Immutability

Pattern where data is never modified directly; instead, new copies are created with changes.

### ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

Next.js feature that updates static pages after deployment without rebuilding the entire site.

---

## J

### JSDoc

Documentation format using special comments in JavaScript/TypeScript files.

```typescript
/**
 * Calculates the total price including tax.
 * @param price - The base price
 * @param taxRate - Tax rate as decimal (e.g., 0.15 for 15%)
 * @returns The total price with tax
 */
function calculateTotal(price: number, taxRate: number): number {
  return price * (1 + taxRate);
}
```

### JSX
