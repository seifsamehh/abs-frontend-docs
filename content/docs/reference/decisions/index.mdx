# 📜 Architecture Decision Records

<Callout type="info">
  Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document the key architectural decisions
  made during the development of our frontend projects. They help new team
  members understand **why** certain choices were made.
</Callout>

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are short documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help teams:

- **Remember** why decisions were made
- **Onboard** new team members quickly
- **Evaluate** past decisions in new contexts
- **Avoid** repeating discussions
