## Study Techniques

### Effective Learning Strategies

<Callout type="info">
  Learning to code is not about memorization—it's about understanding concepts
  and building problem-solving skills.
</Callout>

1. **Active Learning**

   - Type out code examples (don't copy-paste)
   - Modify examples to see what changes
   - Break things intentionally to understand errors

2. **Project-Based Learning**

   - Build something after each concept
   - Start small and iterate
   - Solve real problems you care about

3. **Spaced Repetition**

   - Review concepts at increasing intervals
   - Use flashcards for syntax and patterns
   - Revisit old projects with new knowledge

4. **Teaching Others**
   - Explain concepts to colleagues
   - Write documentation
   - Create tutorials or blog posts
