# 🤖 AI Development Guidelines - Quick Start

This section provides guidelines for using AI tools (Cursor AI, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) in our frontend development workflow.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Copy & Paste Template

Use this template in any AI tool to ensure consistent code generation:

```
# Frontend Development Rules for AI Tools

## Project Structure
- Use feature-based organization in `features/` directory
- Keep `app/` routes minimal, delegate logic to features
- No cross-feature imports - use `index.ts` re-exports
- No logic in UI components - use hooks/services

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (UserCard.tsx)
- Hooks: useCamelCase
- Files: kebab-case (user-profile.tsx)
- Types: PascalCase + suffix (UserType, UserProps)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

## Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types
- Zod validation for all external inputs
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui for styling
- Absolute imports (@/features/...)
- Server components by default, "use client" only when needed

## Testing
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests
- Include tests with all AI-generated code
- Minimum 80% coverage for business logic
- Accessibility testing with axe

## Performance
- Use next/image and next/font
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Animate transform + opacity only
- Use next/dynamic for large modules

## Security
- Validate all external inputs with Zod
- Never rely on client-only auth checks
- Sanitize any HTML content
- Use secure token storage (httpOnly cookies)

## Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatibility

## Required Elements
Every AI-generated code must include:
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Zod validation schemas
- Comprehensive unit tests
- TSDoc documentation
- Accessibility attributes
- Error handling
- Performance optimizations
```

## 📋 How to Use

### 1. Copy the Template

- Go to the [Prompt Template](./prompt-template) page
- Copy the complete template
- Paste it into your AI tool

### 2. Add Your Requirements

- Specify what you want to build
- Include any existing patterns to follow
- Mention specific requirements

### 3. Generate Code

- Let the AI generate the code
- Review thoroughly before using
- Test immediately after generation

## 🎯 Common Use Cases

### Component Generation

```
[Paste template above]

Create a UserProfile component that:
- Displays user information (name, email, avatar)
- Has edit functionality with form validation
- Uses the existing UserCard component pattern
- Includes proper accessibility attributes
- Has comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- Follows our project structure in features/users/
```

### Custom Hook Creation

```
[Paste template above]

Create a custom hook called useUserData that:
- Fetches user data using RTK Query
- Handles loading and error states
- Provides refetch functionality
- Includes proper TypeScript types
- Has unit tests
- Follows our naming conventions
```

### Service Function Development

```
[Paste template above]

Create a service function for user management that:
- Uses RTK Query for API calls
- Includes proper error handling
- Has TypeScript types
- Uses Zod for validation
- Includes unit tests
- Follows our project structure
```

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Security

- Never include sensitive data in AI prompts
- Always validate AI-generated code for security vulnerabilities
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization patterns
- Validate all external inputs with Zod

### Performance

- Review AI-generated code for performance implications
- Check for unnecessary re-renders
- Verify proper memoization usage
- Ensure efficient data fetching patterns

### Quality

- Add clear comments for complex AI-generated logic
- Ensure code follows team conventions
- Include proper error handling
- Make code easily testable and maintainable
