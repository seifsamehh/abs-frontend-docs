# 🚀 Best Practices for AI Development

This guide provides best practices for using AI tools effectively in our frontend development workflow.

## 🎯 Effective AI Usage

### 1. Start with Clear Requirements

**Good Example:**

```
Create a UserProfile component that:
- Displays user information (name, email, avatar)
- Has edit functionality with form validation
- Uses Zod for form validation
- Includes proper TypeScript types
- Has comprehensive tests
- Follows our project structure in features/users/
- Uses Tailwind for styling
- Includes accessibility attributes
```

**Bad Example:**

```
Create a user component
```

### 2. Use Iterative Development

1. **Start Simple** - Generate basic structure first
2. **Add Complexity** - Gradually add features
3. **Refine** - Improve based on results
4. **Test** - Test each iteration

### 3. Provide Context

- **Reference existing code** - "Use the same pattern as UserCard"
- **Include project structure** - "Follow our features/users/ structure"
- **Mention dependencies** - "Use RTK Query for API calls"
- **Specify requirements** - "Must be accessible and responsive"

## 🔧 Prompt Engineering Tips

### Effective Prompt Structure

```
1. [Paste the template]
2. [Add specific requirements]
3. [Include context and examples]
4. [Specify constraints]
5. [Mention quality requirements]
```

### Example Effective Prompt

```
[Paste the complete template from prompt-template.mdx]

Create a UserProfile component that:
- Displays user information (name, email, avatar) in a card layout
- Has edit functionality with a modal form
- Uses the same styling pattern as our existing UserCard component
- Includes form validation with Zod schemas
- Has comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- Follows our project structure in features/users/
- Uses RTK Query for API calls
- Includes proper accessibility attributes
- Supports both light and dark themes
- Is fully responsive for mobile and desktop
```

## 🧪 Testing AI-Generated Code

### Immediate Testing Checklist

- [ ] **Run tests** - Execute all generated tests
- [ ] **Check types** - Verify TypeScript compilation
- [ ] **Test functionality** - Manual testing of features
- [ ] **Accessibility** - Test with axe-core
- [ ] **Performance** - Check for performance issues
- [ ] **Security** - Review for security vulnerabilities

### Common Issues to Check

- **Missing error handling** - Ensure proper error states
- **Accessibility issues** - Check ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
- **Performance problems** - Look for unnecessary re-renders
- **Type safety** - Verify all types are properly defined
- **Test coverage** - Ensure tests cover all functionality

## 🔍 Code Review for AI Code

### Review Checklist

- [ ] **Follows standards** - Matches our code standards
- [ ] **Includes tests** - Has comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] **Proper documentation** - JSDoc comments and README updates
- [ ] **Accessibility** - Meets accessibility requirements
- [ ] **Performance** - No performance regressions
- [ ] **Security** - No security vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Maintainability** - Code is clean and maintainable

### Red Flags to Watch For

- **Generic variable names** - `data`, `item`, `value`
- **Missing error handling** - No try-catch blocks
- **Hardcoded values** - Magic numbers or strings
- **Missing accessibility** - No ARIA attributes
- **Performance issues** - Unnecessary re-renders
- **Security vulnerabilities** - Unsafe patterns

## 📚 Learning from AI

### Use AI to Understand Patterns

- **Ask for explanations** - "Explain how this pattern works"
- **Request alternatives** - "Show me different ways to implement this"
- **Learn best practices** - "What are the best practices for this pattern?"
- **Understand trade-offs** - "What are the pros and cons of this approach?"

### Improve Your Prompts

- **Analyze results** - What worked well? What didn't?
- **Refine prompts** - Update your prompts based on results
- **Share learnings** - Document effective prompt patterns
- **Iterate** - Continuously improve your AI usage

## 🛠️ Tool-Specific Tips

### Cursor AI

- **Use @-mentions** - Reference specific files or functions
- **Provide context** - Include relevant code snippets
- **Be specific** - Give detailed requirements
- **Iterate** - Use the chat to refine results

### GitHub Copilot

- **Write descriptive comments** - Help Copilot understand intent
- **Use consistent patterns** - Follow established code patterns
- **Review suggestions** - Don't accept everything blindly
- **Provide context** - Include relevant imports and types

### ChatGPT/Claude

- **Provide complete context** - Include all relevant information
- **Use specific examples** - Show what you want
- **Ask for explanations** - Understand the generated code
- **Request alternatives** - Explore different approaches

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Development Workflow

1. **Planning** - Use AI for architecture discussions
2. **Implementation** - Generate boilerplate and repetitive code
3. **Testing** - Generate test cases and improve coverage
4. **Review** - Use AI for code review assistance
5. **Documentation** - Generate documentation and comments

### Quality Assurance

- **Always review** - Never use AI code without review
- **Test thoroughly** - Comprehensive testing is essential
- **Follow standards** - Ensure code meets team standards
- **Document changes** - Add comments for complex logic

## 🚨 Common Pitfalls

### Security Issues

- **Sensitive data** - Never include passwords or API keys in prompts
- **Code injection** - Validate all AI-generated code
- **XSS vulnerabilities** - Sanitize any HTML content
- **CSRF attacks** - Ensure proper CSRF protection

### Performance Problems

- **Unnecessary re-renders** - Check for performance issues
- **Bundle size** - Monitor bundle size impact
- **Memory leaks** - Ensure proper cleanup
- **Inefficient patterns** - Look for anti-patterns

### Quality Issues

- **Generic code** - Avoid overly generic implementations
- **Missing error handling** - Ensure proper error handling
- **Poor accessibility** - Check accessibility requirements
- **Inconsistent patterns** - Follow established patterns

## 📈 Measuring Success

### Metrics to Track

- **Code quality** - Lint errors, type errors, test coverage
- **Performance** - Bundle size, render performance
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance score
- **Security** - Security audit results
- **Maintainability** - Code complexity, documentation quality

### Continuous Improvement

- **Regular reviews** - Review AI usage regularly
- **Team feedback** - Collect feedback from team members
- **Process updates** - Update processes based on learnings
- **Tool evaluation** - Evaluate new AI tools and features
