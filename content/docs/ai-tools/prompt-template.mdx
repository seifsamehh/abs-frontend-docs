# Frontend Development Rules for AI Tools

## Project Structure
- Use feature-based organization in `features/` directory
- Keep `app/` routes minimal, delegate logic to features
- No cross-feature imports - use `index.ts` re-exports
- No logic in UI components - use hooks/services

## Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (UserCard.tsx)
- Hooks: useCamelCase
- Files: kebab-case (user-profile.tsx)
- Types: PascalCase + suffix (UserType, UserProps)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

## Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode - no `any` types
- Zod validation for all external inputs
- Tailwind + shadcn/ui for styling
- Absolute imports (@/features/...)
- Server components by default, "use client" only when needed

## Testing
- Jest + React Testing Library for unit tests
- Include tests with all AI-generated code
- Minimum 80% coverage for business logic
- Accessibility testing with axe

## Performance
- Use next/image and next/font
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Animate transform + opacity only
- Use next/dynamic for large modules

## Security
- Validate all external inputs with Zod
- Never rely on client-only auth checks
- Sanitize any HTML content
- Use secure token storage (httpOnly cookies)

## Accessibility
- Semantic HTML elements
- Proper ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatibility

## Code Quality
- Single responsibility principle
- Small, composable components
- Early returns for better readability
- Proper error handling
- Comprehensive documentation

## Required Elements
Every AI-generated code must include:
- TypeScript types and interfaces
- Zod validation schemas
- Comprehensive unit tests
- TSDoc documentation
- Accessibility attributes
- Error handling
- Performance optimizations
```

## 🚀 How to Use This Template

### Step 1: Copy the Template

1. Select all text between the "---" markers above
2. Copy it to your clipboard
3. Paste it into your AI tool (Cursor AI, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

### Step 2: Add Your Specific Requirements

After pasting the template, add your specific requirements:

```
[Paste the template above]

Create a UserProfile component that:
- Displays user information (name, email, avatar)
- Has edit functionality with form validation
- Uses the existing UserCard component pattern
- Includes proper accessibility attributes
- Has comprehensive tests covering all functionality
- Follows our project structure in features/users/
```

### Step 3: Generate and Review

1. Let the AI generate the code
2. Review the generated code thoroughly
3. Test it immediately
4. Make any necessary adjustments

## 📝 Template Variations

### For Component Generation

```
[Paste template above]

Create a [ComponentName] component that:
- [Specific functionality]
- [Props and state requirements]
- [Styling requirements]
- [Accessibility requirements]
- [Testing requirements]
- [Integration requirements]
```

### For Custom Hooks

```
[Paste template above]

Create a custom hook called use[HookName] that:
- [Specific functionality]
- [Return values]
- [Parameters]
- [Error handling]
- [Performance considerations]
- [Testing requirements]
```

### For Service Functions

```
[Paste template above]

Create a service function for [ServiceName] that:
- [API integration requirements]
- [Data transformation needs]
- [Error handling requirements]
- [Caching requirements]
- [Validation requirements]
- [Testing requirements]
```

### For Test Files

```
[Paste template above]

Create comprehensive tests for [Component/FunctionName] that:
- [Test scenarios to cover]
- [Edge cases to test]
- [Accessibility tests]
- [Performance tests]
- [Integration tests]

```

## 🔧 Customization Tips

### Add Project Context

- Include relevant existing patterns
- Mention specific libraries or frameworks
- Reference similar components in your codebase
- Include any specific business requirements

### Specify Requirements

- Be specific about functionality
- Include performance requirements
- Mention accessibility needs
- Specify testing requirements
- Include documentation needs

### Include Examples

- Reference existing code patterns
- Show expected input/output
- Include usage examples
- Reference design mockups or requirements

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Security Considerations

- Never include sensitive data in prompts
- Use placeholder data instead of real data
- Avoid including API keys or passwords
- Sanitize any generated code before use

### Quality Assurance

- Always review AI-generated code
- Test thoroughly before committing
- Ensure code follows team standards
- Add proper documentation and comments

### Performance

- Check for unnecessary re-renders
- Verify proper memoization usage
- Ensure efficient data fetching
- Test performance impact

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific** - The more specific your requirements, the better the AI output
2. **Use Examples** - Reference existing code patterns when possible
3. **Iterate** - Start with basic implementation, then refine
4. **Test Immediately** - Run tests as soon as code is generated
5. **Review Thoroughly** - Don't assume AI-generated code is perfect
6. **Learn Patterns** - Use AI to understand patterns, not just generate code
7. **Document Changes** - Add comments explaining complex AI-generated logic

Remember: This template is your starting point. Customize it based on your specific needs and project requirements!
