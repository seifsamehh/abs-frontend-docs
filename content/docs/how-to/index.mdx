# 🔧 How-To Guides

<Callout type="info">

## How-To vs Tutorial

| How-To Guides            | Tutorials                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Solve a specific problem | Learn a skill            |
| Assume basic knowledge   | Teach from scratch       |
| Jump to what you need    | Follow start to finish   |
| "How do I configure X?"  | "Let's build X together" |
