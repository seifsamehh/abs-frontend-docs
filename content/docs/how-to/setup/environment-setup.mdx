## Making Your First Contribution

### 1. Get Assigned to a Task

As a new team member, you'll typically start with:

- **Small bug fixes** - Get familiar with the codebase
- **Documentation updates** - Learn the project structure
- **UI improvements** - Work on existing components
- **Feature additions** - Build on existing functionality

Your team lead or mentor will assign you appropriate tasks based on your experience level.

### 2. Understand the Task

Before starting work:

- **Read the task description** thoroughly
- **Ask questions** if anything is unclear
- **Review related code** to understand the context
- **Check existing tests** to understand expected behavior
- **Discuss approach** with your mentor or team lead

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

<Callout type="warn">
  **Daily Workflow Tip:** At the start of each day before you begin working,
  always pull the latest changes from the `stage` branch to ensure your local
  environment is up to date with the team's latest features.
</Callout>

#### Our Branching Strategy

| Branch      | Owner           | Purpose                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Frontend Leader | Production-ready, stable code only                             |
| `stage`     | Coordinator     | Integration branch where features are tested before production |
| `feature/*` | Developers      | Individual feature development                                 |

**Workflow:** `feature/*` → `stage` → `main`

All feature branches should be created from and merged into `stage` first. The coordinator reviews and tests features in `stage`, then the frontend leader promotes stable code to `main`.

```bash
# Start of day: Pull latest from stage to get team's latest work
git checkout stage
git pull origin stage

# Create your feature branch FROM stage (not main)
git checkout -b feature/your-task-name

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

Follow our development standards:

```typescript
// Example: Adding a new component
import { FC } from "react";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";

interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary";
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  disabled?: boolean;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

export const Button: FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  children,
  variant = "primary",
  size = "md",
  disabled = false,
  onClick,
}) => {
  return (
    <button
      className={cn("rounded-md font-medium transition-colors", {
        "bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700": variant === "primary",
        "bg-gray-200 text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-300": variant === "secondary",
        "px-2 py-1 text-sm": size === "sm",
        "px-4 py-2 text-base": size === "md",
        "px-6 py-3 text-lg": size === "lg",
        "opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed": disabled,
      })}
      disabled={disabled}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### 5. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run the development server
npm run dev

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm run test

# Format code
npm run format
```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional commit format
git commit -m "feat: add new button component with variants"

# Push to your branch
git push origin feature/your-task-name
```

   - Include **Screenshots** if UI changes
   - Add **Testing notes** if applicable
   - Include **Any questions** for reviewers
5. Request review from your mentor or team lead

### 8. Address Feedback

- **Respond to comments** promptly
- **Make requested changes** carefully
- **Ask for clarification** if needed
- **Test changes** after each update
- **Update your PR** with new commits

### 9. Celebrate Your First Contribution! 🎉
